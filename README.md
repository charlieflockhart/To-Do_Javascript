## About This Project  

I created this to-do list app as a personal project to enhance my JavaScript skills and build something practical for my portfolio. The goal is to explore modular JavaScript development, improve my understanding of event handling, local storage, and drag-and-drop functionality, and create a well-structured, maintainable application.  

This project also serves as a hands-on experience in working with JSON data import/export and implementing user-friendly task management features.
